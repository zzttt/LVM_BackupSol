blkdeactivate \- utility to deactivate block devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blkdeactivate
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ device... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
blkdeactivate utility deactivates block devices. If a device
is mounted, the utility can unmount it automatically before
trying to deactivate. The utility currently supports
\fIdevice-mapper\fP devices, including \fILVM\fP volumes.
LVM volumes are handled directly using the \fIlvm\fP command.
Other device-mapper based devices are handled using the
\fIdmsetup\fP command.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Display the help text.
.IP "\fB\-u, \-\-umount\fP"
Unmount a mounted device before trying to deactivate it.
Without this option used, a device that is mounted is not deactivated.
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-dmoption\fP \fIdm_options\fP"
Comma separated list of device-mapper specific options.
.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-lvmoption\fP \fIlvm_options\fP"
Comma separated list of LVM specific options.
.SH DM_OPTIONS
.IP "\fBretry\fP"
Retry removal several times in case of failure.
.IP "\fBforce\fP"
Force device removal. See \fBdmsetup\fP(8) for more information.
.SH LVM_OPTIONS
.IP "\fBretry\fP"
Retry removal several times in case of failure.
.IP "\fBwholevg\fP"
