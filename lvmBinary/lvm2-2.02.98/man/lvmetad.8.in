.SH DESCRIPTION
lvmetad is a metadata caching daemon for LVM. The daemon receives notifications
from udev rules (which must be installed for LVM to work correctly when lvmetad
is in use). Through these notifications, lvmetad has an up-to-date and
consistent image of the volume groups available in the system.

By default, lvmetad, even if running, is not used by LVM. See \fBlvm.conf\fP(5).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-l " {" \fIall | \fIwire | \fIdebug }
Select the type of log messages to generate.
Messages are logged by syslog.  
Additionally, when -f is given they are also sent to standard error.
Since release 2.02.98, there are two classes of messages: wire and debug.
Selecting 'all' supplies both and is equivalent to a comma-separated list
-l wire,debug.
Prior to release 2.02.98, repeating -d from 1 to 3 times, viz. -d, -dd, -ddd,
increased the detail of messages.
