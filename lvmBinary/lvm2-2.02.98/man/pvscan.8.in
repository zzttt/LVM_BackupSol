.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-activate " " \fIay
Together with the information already cached in lvmetad, automatically activate
any logical volumes that become activatable after the scan done on one or more devices.
The logical volume to autoactivate is matched against the
activation/auto_activation_volume_list set in lvm.conf. Autoactivation is not yet
supported on logical volumes that are part of partial or clustered volume groups.
.TP
.BR \-\-cache " [" \-\-major " " \fImajor " " \-\-minor " " \fIminor " | " \fIDevicePath " ]..."
Scan one or more devices and instruct the lvmetad daemon to update its cached
state accordingly.  Called internally by udev rules.
All devices listed explicitly are processed \fBregardless\fP of any device
filters set in lvm.conf.
